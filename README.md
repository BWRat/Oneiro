## Given brief:
Develop a narrative puzzle based adventure game, where the player discovers themselves ‘awake’ in their own dreamland, and they must escape back to the waking world before the dawn -  or be trapped forever.
The game is to be somewhat abstract, and quirky – but with a slightly malevolent edge. 
Consider games such as ‘Limbo’ and ‘INSIDE’ for gameplay, but with ‘Journey’, ‘ABZU’ and ‘RiME’ as inspiration in terms of mood and feel.

One player, with controller.
